#### HyperRamp

HyperRamp is a decentralized peer to peer on/off ramp based on https://www.reclaimprotocol.org/

### How does it work?

- A has crypto on-chain
- B has fiat in his/her bank account
- A submits their bank account number and bank name to a smart contract
- B submits their bank account number and bank name to a smart contract
- A deposits crypto into an on-chain smart contract (escrow)
- B transfer the fiat to Aâ€™s bank account
- B generates a zero knowledge proof that they did the transfer
- B submits the zero knowledge proof to escrow to release the crypto
